MoneyCalculator
===============

Application project done for the Software Engineering II subject.

It consists of an app that takes an amount of money as an input and exchanges it's value to another currency based on a rate. During the process we learned to apply some design patterns as well as little tricks to make our code more legible, organized and, in general, well written.
